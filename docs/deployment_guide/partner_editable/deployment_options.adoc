// Edit this placeholder text as necessary to describe the deployment options.

This Partner Solution provides the following deployment options:

* https://fwd.aws/wedgV?[Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into a new VPC (end-to-end deployment)^]. This option builds a new AWS environment that consists of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, bastion hosts, EKS cluster, a node group, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys {partner-product-short-name} into this EKS cluster.
* https://fwd.aws/y4NgP?[Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into a new EKS cluster of an existing VPC^]. This option builds a new Amazon EKS cluster, node group, and other infrastructure components into an existing VPC. It then deploys {partner-product-short-name} into this new EKS cluster.
* https://fwd.aws/y4NgP?[Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into an existing EKS cluster^]. This option provisions {partner-product-short-name} in your existing AWS infrastructure. Note that when deploying into an EKS cluster that was not created by the Amazon EKS on the AWS Cloud Partner Solution, you must prepare the cluster as described in the Predeployment steps section.

This Partner Solution provides separate templates for these options. It also lets you configure Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks, instance types, and {partner-product-short-name} settings.
